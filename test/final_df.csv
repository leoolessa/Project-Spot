I am not a sports fan, but someone recommended me this place just for the food and i was not dissapointed, really nice! üëå","This was unexpectedly good!
I was very sceptical about this place, as I saw it as a sport bar for tourists (a lot of times I was passing by and saw tons of visitors speaking English and french). But this time I decided to give it a try and I‚Äôm so happy I did it
It‚Äôs a nice place run by Italians and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. The only thing that was a bit off for me was that I didn‚Äôt know what to order and my friend made an order very fast, so the staff were bothering me too often, checking every 2 minutes of I decided on what I want to eat üòÑ
These Italian guys are very nice, they tried to give me some recommendations and have a little conversation
We waited for the food about 15 minutes, not more than that and it was pretty tasty. The pizza that I ordered was very big and the thin dough of it was very good. Of course you need to eat it with a fork and knife, I don‚Äôt really know how to roll it, like Italians do
I ordered my favourite Italian dessert that we also have in Ukraine - baba (—Ä–æ–º–æ–≤–∞—è –±–∞–±–∞) and it was one of the best ones that I ever tried abroad. Not only presentation, but also the taste of it was perfect!
The prices here are also very good, that‚Äôs why this place is so popular, I think
It‚Äôs definitely worth a visit ü§ó","Nice place to go with friends, family or work mates. You have a menu during the week for a bit less than 13 euros. The quality is quite good, and the pizza menu is 10 euros, also tasty. The small things make a difference, for example the coke is a 350ml bottle (big one), and that's difficult to find in restaurants in Barcelona. The service most of the times is so busy and it takes time to get served, however if you're not in a rush, it's perfect.","I really cannot emphasize how good the food here was. I ordered the seafood risotto and the lasagna, and I very thoroughly enjoyed both. I think this might have been my favorite risotto that I've ever had!

The place was sports themed-of course- and was more of a restaurant than an actual bar, but it seemed that it had all of the drinks and mixers necessary for anyone that did want to drink.

Paisano Bistr√≥ has undoubtedly earned its reputation as the best Italian restaurant in Barcelona, if not all of Spain.

Despite the wait for an outdoor table, the aromas that wafted through the air only heightened our anticipation for what was to come.

Once seated, we embarked on a culinary adventure that left our taste buds in a state of sheer bliss. I opted for the ravioli, filled with delectable truffle and Italian sausage, bathing in a heavenly white sauce. Each bite was a revelation, with the flavors meticulously balanced and the textures flawlessly executed. I knew I'd think back on this meal for weeks to come and think to myself with nostalgic feelings, ""I should call him."" An expression normally used for missing an ex somehow seems appropriate for this meal.

My friend had the lasagna, and it was nothing short of extraordinary. The pasta, rich meat sauce, and melted cheese melded together to create a harmonious blend of flavors. It was a classic dish executed with finesse and an undeniable passion for authentic Italian cuisine.

While we had to settle for an outdoor table this time, we have already made a mental note to make reservations for our next visit so we can fully immerse ourselves in the charming and warm interior ambiance.

Paisano Bistr√≥ truly deserves every accolade it receives, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an unforgettable Italian dining experience in Barcelona. Prepare to surrender your senses to the culinary magic that unfolds within its walls. Whether it's a special occasion or simply a desire for exceptional Italian cuisine, this gem of a restaurant will leave you craving for more.","Our pasta dishes were hard and undercooked. Made for really unpleasant eating experience having chewy pasta. Felt like a rock in the stomach. Restaurant vibes was cute, romantic and cozy. In my friend's pasta, we found a small, round metal ball clearly kitchen material. We notified staff who took the dish straight to the kitchen, and the blonde chef just shrugged and denied it. The waiter came back saying they didn't know what it was, and the metal ball wasn't from them! Absurd! They gave a replacement dish which was too salty and garlicky. Worst meal in our holiday to Barcelona. Save your money. Avoid.","Paisano Bistro in Spain offers a delightful experience with great pizza and wine. The setting exudes a good atmosphere, complemented by cool and attentive service. It sounds like a fantastic place to enjoy a meal!","Eveything was absolutely incredible - the people, the owner, the food, the ambience and the prices were very reasonable. I found this gem of a restaurant through google reviews towards the end of my solo trip so I had the chance to go back twice for lunch. I would honestly eat here every day if I found this sooner. I loved that there was outdoor seating available on this quaint street, great for people watching or to simply read a book. ELMO and DISERIA (?) were so sweet and friendly, they really made me feel at home. I met the owner as I was walking out and complimented him on such a fine establishment and employees, he was equally as sweet. I wanted to try everything on the menu but the eggplant croquette was phenomenal along with the 2 pasta dishes I tried, and the pistachio tiramisu was to die for. I will definately be back when I make a trip back to Barcelona. The service was top notch as well as the food. I cannot boost enough about this restaurant, you really should give it a try. There is no way you would be dissapointed. It is really hard to find a place that delivers on customer experience and food along with affordable prices.

The interior of the space is bright, welcoming and well lay out. Seating is comfortable. I really love how the slave was designed.

The pizza is good. I wish it was heated a bit more to warm up the pizza better. Pepperoni pizza for the win. The homemade lemonade is great. Ate pizza a couple time during my stay.

I tried both the breakfast buffet and a la cart option. If you're not hungry, go a la cart as it may work out to be a cheaper meal. The sourdough bread with pear, walnut and honey is a perfect light way to start your day.

The orange juice is great... mix OJ and grapefruit together for your morning mix  The fruit has a great selection and was tasty and fresh. The bacon is cooked to long, imo. I like my bacon less crunchy and more chewy. It tasted good still and ate more than I should. The sausage was great and I ate a few of those. The cranberries loaf wasn't for me.

Eggs are tasty. They were sold out of some croissants during my stay which means I couldn't taste them. Buffet breakfast is nice but only makes sense if someone is super hungry to get value for money.","Went to Four Corners twice and loved it.
